### Sample issues by severity

#### STORY_RESOLUTION_NO_DRAWN

- `G1-09` (form `(symbol? 42)`): story-tagged example's resolution slot has no drawn-value reference (form has literals ('42',), resolution doesn't close the loop)
    ```
    The sun rose in the woods, and with it the question of who could outrun whom.

"There's a difference between *labeling* the form and
*evaluating* it," Stillpaw the tortoise, stepping deliberately, said. "Quote in any of its
shapes is the labeling — the runtime hands you back the form,
not its value,...
    ```
- `G1-09` (form `(symbol? 42)`): story-tagged example's resolution slot has no drawn-value reference (form has literals ('42',), resolution doesn't close the loop)
    ```
    In that part of the woods, no one ever expected the slow to outpace the swift, yet the question was always quietly asked.

"There's a difference between *labeling* the form and
*evaluating* it," Elder the tortoise, without complaint, said. "Quote in any of its
shapes is the labeling — the runtime ha...
    ```
- `G1-13` (form `(- 5 3)`): story-tagged example's resolution slot has no drawn-value reference (form has literals ('5', '3'), resolution doesn't close the loop)
    ```
    at the edge of the forest, a Hare and a Tortoise once made a wager that the meadow still talks about.

Snickerkin the hare eyed the heap, with a smug grin, and called out a guess
about how many acorns were there without bothering to count.
Elder the tortoise simply began counting — to subtract 3 fro...
    ```
- `G1-13` (form `(- 5 3)`): story-tagged example's resolution slot has no drawn-value reference (form has literals ('5', '3'), resolution doesn't close the loop)
    ```
    Some say it began with a yawn and a laugh; others say it began with a quiet refusal to be laughed at.

Slowpoke the tortoise had stockpiled 5 acorns near the hollow log. During the night, squirrels had carried off 3 of them.

Slowpoke needed the remaining count before deciding whether the stockpile ...

    ```
    Flit was the first to laugh and the first to boast, and Cambium simply began to walk.

"Whatever the heap looks like after the operation,"
Cambium the tortoise, with eyes always on the path, said, "the runtime gives the exact count —
small or large, fraction or whole, the answer is precise." To
subt...
    ```

#### CONCEPT_AS_VERB

- `G1-15` (form `(= 1 1)`): concept_phrase substituted into a finite-verb slot (e.g. 'must calling X', 'I applying Y')
    ```
    Spring had loosened the soil and the grasses had grown tall enough to brush a passing flank.

"You can't tell which way the gate will swing by guessing,"
Twig the tortoise, saying very little, said. "You bring the value to the gate, the
runtime checks it, and the gate gives the only answer that

    ```
- `G2-13` (form `(or false true)`): concept_phrase substituted into a finite-verb slot (e.g. 'must calling X', 'I applying Y')
    ```
    It happened on the road, on a morning when the air was kind to swift feet and steady ones alike.

"You can't tell which way the gate will swing by guessing,"
Tussock the tortoise, stepping deliberately, said. "You bring the value to the gate, the
runtime checks it, and the gate gives the only answer...
    ```
- `G2-13` (form `(or false false)`): concept_phrase substituted into a finite-verb slot (e.g. 'must calling X', 'I applying Y')
    ```
    The sun rose along the road, and with it the question of who could outrun whom.

"You can't tell which way the gate will swing by guessing,"
Oakheart the tortoise, saying very little, said. "You bring the value to the gate, the
runtime checks it, and the gate gives the only answer that
matters." To ...
    ```
- `G2-14` (form `(not 0)`): concept_phrase substituted into a finite-verb slot (e.g. 'must calling X', 'I applying Y')
    ```
    Spring had loosened the soil and the grasses had grown tall enough to brush a passing flank.

"You can't tell which way the gate will swing by guessing,"
Hillock the tortoise, saying very little, said. "You bring the value to the gate, the
runtime checks it, and the gate gives the only answer that

    ```
- `G2-15` (form `(if false 1 0)`): concept_phrase substituted into a finite-verb slot (e.g. 'must calling X', 'I applying Y')
    ```
    When Hedgepig the hare declared the race already won, no one yet knew how long the afternoon would be.

"You can't tell which way the gate will swing by guessing,"
Glen the tortoise, with steady, careful steps, said. "You bring the value to the gate, the
runtime checks it, and the gate gives the onl...
    ```

#### HIGH_LENGTH

- `G3-10` (form `(#(+ % 1) 5)`): user_msg 205 words
    ```
    Among the small kingdoms of the meadow, swiftness was a kind of currency, and one creature spent it loudly.

Mossback was in a hurry at the roadside and had no time to write a full recipe card. She scratched a quick shorthand mark — `#(+ % 1)` — on a stone and put 5 acorns in front of it immediately...
    ```
- `G3-13` (form `((fn [x] x x x 99) 1)`): user_msg 201 words
    ```
    By the time the dew had lifted, the meadow had gathered to watch the strangest race anyone could remember.

Mossback's recipe card for this stretch listed several intermediate steps, but the cook only served the final dish — everything before it was preparation, not what got plated.

The kitchen nee...
    ```
- `G8-02` (form `(do (deftype Stone [weight]) (.-weight (Stone. 7)))`): user_msg 202 words
    ```
    It is one thing to have fast legs and another to know how to use them, as the meadow folk would soon be reminded.

Pip the hare found a smooth stone on the path and wanted to record its weight in a bare carrying-case. Mossback showed him that `deftype` could shape a case with a single weight slot — ...
    ```
- `G8-03` (form `(do (defrecord Runner [name pace]) (:pace (->Runner "Alice" `): user_msg 207 words
    ```
    Galop announced the race in a voice loud enough to wake the owls, and Fen accepted with a nod.

Mossback the tortoise was outfitting the meadow's runners with carrying-cases — small wooden cases with two named compartments inside, one labeled `name` and one labeled `pace`. The case-stamp on the outs...
    ```
- `G8-08` (form `(do (defmulti pace :species) (defmethod pace :hare [_] :swif`): user_msg 209 words
    ```
    Among the small kingdoms of the meadow, swiftness was a kind of currency, and one creature spent it loudly.

Mossback the tortoise set up a sorting-table at the edge of the meadow. Runners would walk up; the table would read each runner's :species stamp and route them to the matching arm.

Today's f...
    ```

#### ANSWER_LEAK_STRING

- `G6-01` (form `(name 'foo.bar)`): answer string 'foo.bar' appears in user_msg
    ```
    Some say it began with a yawn and a laugh; others say it began with a quiet refusal to be laughed at.

On the long road, there lay a library shelf holding scrolls. Each scroll had a name — foo.bar, tortoise.race — inscribed on its spine in the style of the land.

Mossback the tortoise needed to know...
    ```
- `G6-15` (form `(:doc (meta '\{:doc "steady wins"\} race))`): answer string 'steady wins' appears in user_msg
    ```
    Two creatures of very different gait once agreed that the ground between two stones would settle a long argument.

On a scroll lay a symbol race, marked with marginalia in the margin: ^{:doc "steady wins"}. The margin held a note — a docstring — explaining what the symbol was about.

Mossback wanted...
    ```
- `G7-11` (form `(try (throw (ex-info "trouble" {})) (catch Exception e (.get`): answer string 'trouble' appears in user_msg
    ```
    Among the small kingdoms of the meadow, swiftness was a kind of currency, and one creature spent it loudly.

Lichen the tortoise, with eyes always on the path, stretched a small net beneath a high jump
at the edge of the woods. "If the runner falls, the net catches them; the run
doesn't end, only th...
    ```

#### LOW_GROUNDING

- `G6-14` (form `(symbol? 'java.util.List)`): user_msg lacks both a form-literal anchor and an EMO-pool phrase — no environmental grounding
    ```
    It is one thing to have fast legs and another to know how to use them, as the meadow folk would soon be reminded.

Calmway the tortoise reached into a different toolshed in the forest and
pulled out a tool he hadn't carved himself
— a tool from the host platform. "This isn't ours," he
said, "but we ...
    ```
- `G10-05` (form `(macroexpand '(-> 1 inc inc))`): user_msg lacks both a form-literal anchor and an EMO-pool phrase — no environmental grounding
    ```
    Some say it began with a yawn and a laugh; others say it began with a quiet refusal to be laughed at.

Heartwood the tortoise sat at a small writing desk by the garden, quill in
paw. "A macro," he said, "is a rule that rewrites
the recipe before the runtime ever cooks it. You write the rule
once, an...
    ```
- `G10-06` (form `(when-not false :ok)`): user_msg lacks both a form-literal anchor and an EMO-pool phrase — no environmental grounding
    ```
    The Hare and the Tortoise had argued for as long as anyone could remember about who was truly the faster.

Sable the tortoise sat at a small writing desk atop the hilltop, quill in
paw. "A macro," he said, "is a rule that rewrites
the recipe before the runtime ever cooks it. You write the rule
once,...
    ```
- `G10-14` (form `(eval '(+ 1 2 3))`): user_msg lacks both a form-literal anchor and an EMO-pool phrase — no environmental grounding
    ```
    It is one thing to have fast legs and another to know how to use them, as the meadow folk would soon be reminded.

paw. "A macro," he said, "is a rule that rewrites

    ```
- `G11-06` (form `(String. "go")`): user_msg lacks both a form-literal anchor and an EMO-pool phrase — no environmental grounding
    ```
    It is one thing to have fast legs and another to know how to use them, as the meadow folk would soon be reminded.

Boulderkin the tortoise reached into a different toolshed in the forest and
pulled out a tool she hadn't carved herself
— a tool from the host platform. "This isn't ours," she
said, "bu...
